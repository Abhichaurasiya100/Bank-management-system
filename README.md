Bank Management system in c with file operation
1.	Aim of the Micro Project:
The main aim of designing and developing this banking management System secure and efficient banking facilities to the banking administrative. Csv file is used to store customers details and to develop this bank application where admin can login through the application and manage. Users will have all options and features in that application like deposit money, withdrawal money, open new account and close existing account.

1.	Rationale:
The Bank Account Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a banking account system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Account Management System. To develop a project for solving financial applications of a customer in banking environment in order to nurture the needs of an end banking user by providing various ways to perform banking tasks.
This project is developed using C language.
C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.

4.	Literature Review:
•	stdio.h is a header file which includes all standard I/O operations. Basically, it contains the prototypes of all the input output functions used in C, remember it contains only function type signature not the actual implementation.

By including it we tell the compiler that what are the parameters and return type of the functions we are using in our code. It gets replaced by its contents in the pre-processing phase of C program.
•	stdlib.h is the header of the general-purpose standard library of C programming language which includes functions involving memory allocation, process control, conversions and others. It is compatible with C++ and is known as cstdlib in C++. The name "stdlib" stands for "standard library".

•	string.h is the header in the C standard library for the C programming language which contains macro definitions, constants and declarations of functions and types used not only for string handling but also various memory handling functions; the name is thus something of a misnomer.

Functions declared in string.h are extremely popular, since as a part of the C standard library, they are guaranteed to work on any platform which supports C. However, some security issues exist with these functions, such as buffer overflows, leading programmers to prefer safer, possibly less portable variants. Also, the string functions only work with characters encodings made of bytes, such as ASCII and UTF-8. In historical documentation the term "character" was often used instead of "byte", which if followed literally would mean that multi-byte encodings such as UTF-8 were not supported. The BSD documentation has been fixed to make this clear, but POSIX, Linux, and Windows documentation still uses "character" in many places. Functions to handle character encodings made up of larger code units than bytes, such as UTF-16 is generally achieved through wchar.h
